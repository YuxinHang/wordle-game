## Manual

In this game, every round a 5-letter-long English word will be generated randomly. You goal is to find the word in several turns.

In every turn (every row), you can guess the word by entering 5 letters. Then you can click Enter button. It will reveal the results of your guessing:

1. For a letter which is exactly in that slot, the slot will become green;
2. For a letter which is not in that slot but appears somewhere else in this word, the slot will become yellow;
3. Otherwise the slot will keep grey.

When you find the correct word, or you use up all your chances, a modal will pop up and show the result.

## Interesting points

We integrated many interesting points to catch your eyes.
